        <h2><b><u>What Is E-Commerce?</u></b></h2>
        <h3>E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet. E-commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. E-commerce is in turn driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry, and is the largest sector of the electronics industry.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce#Defining_e-commerce">click Here To Know More about E-Commerce</a></h3>

        <h2><b>Business To Business, B2B</b></h2>
        <h3>Business-to-business (B2B or, in some countries, BtoB) is a situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with another. This typically occurs when:

            A business is sourcing materials for their production process for output (e.g., a food manufacturer purchasing salt), i.e. providing raw material to the other company that will produce output.
            A business needs the services of another for operational reasons (e.g., a food manufacturer employing an accountancy firm to audit their finances).
            A business re-sells goods and services produced by others (e.g., a retailer buying the end product from the food manufacturer).<br><a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business>To Know More About B2B click here</a></h3>

            <h2><b>Business To Consumer, B2C</b></h2>
            <h3>Direct-to-consumer (DTC) or business-to-consumer (B2C) refers to selling products directly to customers, bypassing any third-party retailers, wholesalers, or any other middlemen.[citation needed] DTC brands are usually sold online only and specialize in a specific product category. Some direct-to-consumer brands have opened a limited number of physical retail spaces in adjunct to their main e-commerce platform in a clicks-and-mortar business model.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-to-consumer">Click Here To know More about B2C</a></h3>

            <h2><b>Consumer To Consumer</b></h2>
            <h3>Consumer to consumer (C2C) markets provide a way to allow customers to interact with each other. Traditional markets require business to customer relationships, in which a customer goes to the business in order to purchase a product or service. In customer to customer markets, the business facilitates an environment where customers can sell goods or services to each other.[1] Other types of markets include business to business (B2B) and business to customer (B2C).[2]

                Consumer to consumer (or citizen-to-citizen) electronic commerce involves the electronically facilitated transactions between consumers through some third party. A common example is an online auction, in which a consumer posts an item for sale and other consumers bid to purchase it; the third party generally charges a flat fee or commission. The sites are only intermediaries, just there to match consumers. They do not have to check quality of the products being offered.
                
                Consumer to consumer[3] (C2C) marketing is the creation of a product or service with the specific promotional strategy being for consumers to share that product or service with others as brand advocates based on the value of the product. The investment into conceptualising and developing a top-of-the-line product or service that consumers are actively looking for is equitable to a retail pre-launch product awareness marketing.[3]<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_to_customer">Click Here To Know More about C2C</a></h3>
